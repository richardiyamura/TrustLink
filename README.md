TrustLink is a Soroban smart contract that provides a reusable trust layer for the Stellar blockchain. It enables trusted issuers, bridge contracts, and administrators to create, import, manage, and revoke attestations about wallet addresses, allowing other contracts and applications to verify claims before executing financial operations.

## Overview

TrustLink solves the problem of decentralized identity verification and trust establishment on-chain. Instead of each application building its own KYC/verification system, TrustLink provides a shared attestation infrastructure that can be queried by any smart contract or dApp.

### Key Features

- **Authorized Issuers**: Admin-controlled registry of trusted attestation issuers
- **Claim Type Registry**: Admin-managed registry of standard claim types with descriptions
- **Flexible Claims**: Support for any claim type (KYC_PASSED, ACCREDITED_INVESTOR, MERCHANT_VERIFIED, etc.)
- **Expiration Support**: Optional time-based expiration for attestations
- **Historical Import**: Admin can import externally verified attestations with original timestamps
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Support**: Trusted bridge contracts can bring attestations from other chains on-chain
- **Configurable Fees**: Admin can require a token-denominated fee for native attestation creation
- **Revocation**: Issuers can revoke attestations at any time
- **Deterministic IDs**: Attestations have unique, reproducible identifiers
- **Event Emission**: All state changes emit events for off-chain indexing
- **Query Interface**: Easy verification of claims for other contracts
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Efficient listing and date-range searching of attestations

## Security

TrustLink is designed with security as a first-class concern. Before mainnet deployment with real funds, the contract undergoes comprehensive external security audits.

### Audit Status

- **Current Status:** Security audit in progress
- **Audit Scope:** [AUDIT_SCOPE.md](./AUDIT_SCOPE.md)
- **Firm Selection:** [AUDIT_FIRM_SELECTION.md](./AUDIT_FIRM_SELECTION.md)
- **Security Review:** [docs/security-review.md](./docs/security-review.md)
- **Security Model:** [docs/security.md](./docs/security.md)

### Pre-Audit Findings

Three security findings were identified in the pre-audit review and must be resolved before mainnet deployment:

1. **FINDING-001 [MEDIUM]:** `initialize()` state read before auth
2. **FINDING-002 [HIGH]:** `revoke_attestation()` missing `require_issuer` check
3. **FINDING-003 [HIGH]:** `update_expiration()` missing `require_issuer` check

See [docs/security-review.md](./docs/security-review.md) for details and remediation.

### Data Model

**Attestation Structure:**

```rust
{
    id: String,               // Deterministic hash-based ID
    issuer: Address,          // Who issued the attestation
    subject: Address,         // Who the attestation is about
    claim_type: String,       // Type of claim (e.g., "KYC_PASSED")
    timestamp: u64,           // When it was created
    expiration: Option<u64>,  // Optional expiration time
    revoked: bool,            // Revocation status
    metadata: Option<String>, // Optional issuer-supplied metadata
    imported: bool,           // True when migrated from an external source
    bridged: bool,            // True when created by a trusted bridge contract
    source_chain: Option<String>, // Chain where the original attestation exists
    source_tx: Option<String> // Source transaction or reference
}
```

**Storage Keys:**

- `Admin`: Contract administrator address
- `FeeConfig`: Global attestation fee settings
- `Issuer(Address)`: Authorized issuer registry
- `Bridge(Address)`: Authorized bridge contract registry
- `Attestation(String)`: Individual attestation data
- `SubjectAttestations(Address)`: Index of attestations per subject
- `IssuerAttestations(Address)`: Index of attestations per issuer
- `ClaimType(String)`: Registered claim type info keyed by identifier
- `ClaimTypeList`: Ordered list of all registered claim type identifiers

## Usage

### Initialization

```rust
// Deploy and initialize with admin and optional custom TTL (days)
// ttl_days: None uses default 30 days, or Some(7) for custom TTL
contract.initialize(&admin_address, &None);
```

### Configure Attestation Fees

Fees are disabled by default. When enabled, `create_attestation` transfers the
configured amount from the issuer to the configured collector before the
attestation is stored.

The contract stores an explicit `fee_token` because Soroban fee collection must
transfer a concrete token contract rather than an abstract currency amount.

```rust
let fee_token = token_contract_address;

contract.set_fee(
    &admin,
    &25,
    &collector_address,
    &Some(fee_token),
);

let fee_config = contract.get_fee_config();
assert_eq!(fee_config.attestation_fee, 25);
assert_eq!(fee_config.fee_collector, collector_address);
```

### Register Issuers

```rust
// Admin registers a trusted issuer
contract.register_issuer(&admin, &issuer_address);

// Check if address is authorized
let is_authorized = contract.is_issuer(&issuer_address);

// Admin removes an issuer
contract.remove_issuer(&admin, &issuer_address);
```

#### Issuer Removal Behavior

When an issuer is removed via `remove_issuer`:

| Action                                                   | Allowed? | Reason                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existing attestations remain valid                       | Yes      | Attestation validity depends only on revocation and expiration status, not issuer registration                       |
| `has_valid_claim` returns true for existing attestations | Yes      | Validity checks do not verify issuer registration                                                                    |
| Removed issuer creates new attestations                  | **No**   | `create_attestation` calls `require_issuer`, which rejects unregistered issuers                                      |
| Removed issuer revokes their own attestations            | Yes      | `revoke_attestation` only checks that the caller matches the attestation's original issuer, not current registration |

This is by design — attestations represent signed facts at a point in time. Removing an issuer prevents future issuance but does not retroactively invalidate previously issued attestations.

### Register Bridge Contracts

Bridge contracts use a separate trust registry from regular issuers.

```rust
contract.register_bridge(&admin, &bridge_contract_address);

let is_bridge = contract.is_bridge(&bridge_contract_address);
```

### Claim Type Registry

The contract ships with a set of standard claim types that the admin can pre-register on deployment.

| Claim Type            | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `KYC_PASSED`          | Subject has passed KYC identity verification     |
| `ACCREDITED_INVESTOR` | Subject qualifies as an accredited investor      |
| `MERCHANT_VERIFIED`   | Subject is a verified merchant                   |
| `AML_CLEARED`         | Subject has passed AML screening                 |
| `SANCTIONS_CHECKED`   | Subject has been checked against sanctions lists |

```rust
// Admin registers a claim type
contract.register_claim_type(
    &admin,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    &String::from_str(&env, "Subject has passed KYC identity verification"),
);

// Look up a description
let desc = contract.get_claim_type_description(&String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"));

// List registered types (paginated)
let page1 = contract.list_claim_types(&0, &10);
```

### Create Attestations

Issuers cannot create an attestation where they are also the subject (`issuer ==
subject`); that would allow trivial self-certification. The contract returns
`Unauthorized` in that case.

If fees are enabled, the issuer must hold enough of the configured token for
the transfer to succeed.

```rust
// Issuer creates a KYC attestation
let attestation_id = contract.create_attestation(
    &issuer,
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    &None,  // No expiration
    &None   // No metadata
);

// Create attestation with expiration
let expiration_time = current_timestamp + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 1 year
let attestation_id = contract.create_attestation(
    &issuer,
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "ACCREDITED_INVESTOR"),
    &Some(expiration_time),
    &None
);
```

### Import Historical Attestations

Use this when migrating records from another verified system. The admin performs
the import, but the imported record is still attached to a registered issuer.

```rust
let historical_timestamp = 1_700_000_000;
let expiration = Some(1_731_536_000);

let imported_id = contract.import_attestation(
    &admin,
    &issuer,
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    &historical_timestamp,
    &expiration,
);

let attestation = contract.get_attestation(&imported_id);
assert!(attestation.imported);
assert_eq!(attestation.timestamp, historical_timestamp);
```

### Bridge Cross-Chain Attestations

Use this when a trusted bridge contract is mirroring an attestation that was
verified on another chain. The bridge contract becomes the on-chain attestation
creator, while the original source is preserved on the record.

```rust
let bridged_id = contract.bridge_attestation(
    &bridge_contract_address,
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    &String::from_str(&env, "ethereum"),
    &String::from_str(&env, "0xabc123"),
);

let attestation = contract.get_attestation(&bridged_id);
assert!(attestation.bridged);
assert_eq!(attestation.source_chain, Some(String::from_str(&env, "ethereum")));
assert_eq!(attestation.source_tx, Some(String::from_str(&env, "0xabc123")));
```

### Verify Claims

```rust
// Check if user has valid KYC
let has_kyc = contract.has_valid_claim(
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED")
);

if has_kyc {
    // Proceed with financial operation
}

// Check if user has valid KYC from a specific issuer
let has_specific_kyc = contract.has_valid_claim_from_issuer(
    &user_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    &specific_issuer_address
);
```

#### Multi-issuer behavior

A subject may hold the same claim type issued by multiple issuers. `has_valid_claim` uses OR-logic across all issuers — it returns `true` if **any one** attestation for that claim type is currently valid, regardless of the state of the others.

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Two issuers, both valid | `true` |
| Two issuers, one revoked, one valid | `true` |
| Two issuers, one expired, one valid | `true` |
| Two issuers, both revoked | `false` |
| Two issuers, both expired | `false` |

Use `has_valid_claim_from_issuer` when you need to verify a claim from a specific trusted issuer rather than any issuer in the registry.

### Verify Any of Multiple Claims

`has_any_claim(env: Env, subject: Address, claim_types: Vec<String>) -> bool`

| Parameter     | Type          | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `env`         | `Env`         | Soroban environment (ledger time, storage)  |
| `subject`     | `Address`     | The address whose attestations are queried  |
| `claim_types` | `Vec<String>` | One or more claim type identifiers to check |

Returns `true` if the subject holds at least one valid attestation matching any of the listed claim types; `false` otherwise.

**Behavior:**

- Uses OR-logic — returns `true` on the first valid match found (short-circuit evaluation)
- An empty `claim_types` list always returns `false`
- Revoked, expired, and pending attestations are excluded from matching

```rust
// Check if user has either KYC or an accredited investor credential
let claim_types = vec![
    &env,
    String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"),
    String::from_str(&env, "ACCREDITED_INVESTOR"),
    String::from_str(&env, "MERCHANT_VERIFIED"),
];
let has_any = contract.has_any_claim(&user_address, &claim_types);

if has_any {
    // Proceed — user satisfies at least one required credential
}
```

**Relationship to `has_valid_claim`:** Calling `has_any_claim` with a single-element list is equivalent to calling `has_valid_claim` with that same claim type. Use `has_valid_claim` when checking a single claim type, and `has_any_claim` when OR-logic across multiple claim types is needed.

### Verify All of Multiple Claims

`has_all_claims(env: Env, subject: Address, claim_types: Vec<String>) -> bool`

| Parameter     | Type          | Description                                   |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `env`         | `Env`         | Soroban environment (ledger time, storage)    |
| `subject`     | `Address`     | The address whose attestations are queried    |
| `claim_types` | `Vec<String>` | All claim type identifiers that must be valid |

Returns `true` only if the subject holds a valid attestation for **every** claim type in the list; `false` as soon as any one is missing, revoked, expired, or pending.

**Behavior:**

- Uses AND-logic — short-circuits and returns `false` on the first unsatisfied claim type
- An empty `claim_types` list always returns `true` (vacuous truth)
- Revoked, expired, and pending attestations are excluded from matching

```rust
// Require the user to hold ALL three credentials before proceeding
let mut required = soroban_sdk::Vec::new(&env);
required.push_back(String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"));
required.push_back(String::from_str(&env, "ACCREDITED_INVESTOR"));
required.push_back(String::from_str(&env, "AML_CLEARED"));

let fully_verified = trustlink.has_all_claims(&user_address, &required);

if fully_verified {
    // All credentials present and valid — proceed with restricted operation
} else {
    // At least one credential is missing, revoked, or expired
    return Err(Error::InsufficientCredentials);
}
```

**Relationship to `has_any_claim`:** `has_any_claim` uses OR-logic (at least one match), while `has_all_claims` uses AND-logic (every claim must match). Use `has_all_claims` when a workflow requires a complete set of credentials, such as high-value lending that demands both KYC and AML clearance.

### Transfer Attestations (Admin Only)

Admin can transfer ownership of an attestation to a new registered issuer. This is useful when an issuer account is deactivated/compromised, allowing orphaned attestations to be re-assigned to a successor issuer.

```rust
// Register the new issuer first
contract.register_issuer(&admin, &new_issuer);

// Transfer attestation ownership
contract.transfer_attestation(&admin, &attestation_id, &new_issuer);
```

**Effects:**
- Updates `issuer` field in attestation record
- Removes ID from old issuer's attestation index
- Adds ID to new issuer's attestation index
- Updates `total_issued` stats for both issuers
- Emits `attestation_transferred` event: `["att_xfer", old_issuer] (attestation_id, new_issuer)`
- Appends `Transferred` audit entry: `actor=admin, details=new_issuer_address`

**Validations:**
- Caller must be admin
- `attestation_id` must exist
- `new_issuer` must be registered
- Idempotent if `old_issuer == new_issuer`

### Revoke Attestations

```rust
// Issuer revokes an attestation
contract.revoke_attestation(&issuer, &attestation_id);
```

### Expiration Hooks

Subjects can register a callback contract to be notified when one of their attestations is approaching expiry. This lets wallets, dApps, or automation contracts react before a credential lapses.

**Flow:**

1. Subject calls `register_expiration_hook` with their callback contract address and how many days before expiry they want to be notified.
2. Whenever `has_valid_claim` is called and a matching attestation is inside the notification window, TrustLink emits an `exp_hook` event and calls `notify_expiring` on the callback contract.
3. If the callback call fails for any reason, the failure is silently swallowed — the main `has_valid_claim` result is unaffected.
4. Subject can overwrite or remove their hook at any time.

**Callback interface** — your contract must implement:

```rust
fn notify_expiring(env: Env, subject: Address, attestation_id: String, expiration: u64);
```

**Usage:**

```rust
// Register: notify me 7 days before any attestation expires
contract.register_expiration_hook(
    &subject,
    &my_callback_contract,
    &7,
);

// Retrieve the current hook
let hook = contract.get_expiration_hook(&subject);

// Remove the hook
contract.remove_expiration_hook(&subject);
```

**Event emitted when hook fires:**

```
topics: ["exp_hook", subject_address]
data:   (attestation_id, expiration_timestamp)
```

**Notes:**

- Only the subject can register or remove their own hook (requires auth).
- Attestations without an expiration never trigger the hook.
- A subject can only have one hook at a time; re-registering overwrites the previous one.
- Failed callback calls do not revert or affect the caller.

### Multi-Sig Attestations

High-value claims (e.g. `ACCREDITED_INVESTOR`) can require M-of-N registered issuers to co-sign before the attestation becomes active. This prevents a single compromised issuer from unilaterally issuing sensitive credentials.

**Flow:**

1. A registered issuer calls `propose_attestation` — they automatically count as the first signer.
2. Other required issuers call `cosign_attestation` with the returned `proposal_id`.
3. Once the number of signatures reaches `threshold`, the attestation is finalized and stored as a normal active attestation.
4. Proposals expire after 7 days if the threshold is not reached.

```rust
// Build the required-signers list (all must be registered issuers)
let mut required_signers = soroban_sdk::Vec::new(&env);
required_signers.push_back(issuer_a.clone());
required_signers.push_back(issuer_b.clone());
required_signers.push_back(issuer_c.clone());

// Propose a 2-of-3 multi-sig attestation
let proposal_id = contract.propose_attestation(
    &issuer_a,                                          // proposer (auto-signs)
    &user_address,                                      // subject
    &String::from_str(&env, "ACCREDITED_INVESTOR"),     // claim type
    &required_signers,                                  // all required signers
    &2,                                                 // threshold
);

// issuer_b co-signs — threshold reached, attestation activated
contract.cosign_attestation(&issuer_b, &proposal_id);

assert!(contract.has_valid_claim(&user_address, &String::from_str(&env, "ACCREDITED_INVESTOR")));
```

**Inspect a proposal:**

```rust
let proposal = contract.get_multisig_proposal(&proposal_id);
// proposal.signers     — addresses that have signed so far
// proposal.threshold   — required number of signatures
// proposal.finalized   — true once the attestation is active
// proposal.expires_at  — unix timestamp after which cosigning is rejected
```

**Error cases:**

- `InvalidThreshold` — threshold is 0 or exceeds the number of required signers
- `Unauthorized` — proposer or a required signer is not a registered issuer
- `NotRequiredSigner` — cosigner is not in the proposal's required-signers list
- `AlreadySigned` — the issuer has already co-signed this proposal
- `ProposalFinalized` — the proposal has already been activated
- `ProposalExpired` — the 7-day window has passed without reaching threshold

**Events emitted:**

```
topics: ["ms_prop", subject_address]   data: (proposal_id, proposer, threshold)
topics: ["ms_sign", signer_address]    data: (proposal_id, signatures_so_far, threshold)
topics: ["ms_actv"]                    data: (proposal_id, attestation_id)
```

### Query Attestations

```rust
// Get specific attestation
let attestation = contract.get_attestation(&attestation_id);

// Check status
let status = contract.get_attestation_status(&attestation_id);
// Returns: Valid, Expired, or Revoked

// Find the most recent valid attestation by subject + claim type
let attestation = contract.get_attestation_by_type(&user_address, &String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED"));

// Count queries — returns total count, no pagination needed
let total = contract.get_subject_attestation_count(&user_address); // all attestations (incl. revoked/expired)
let issued = contract.get_issuer_attestation_count(&issuer_address); // all issued by this issuer
let valid  = contract.get_valid_claim_count(&user_address);          // only non-revoked, non-expired

// List user's attestations (paginated)
let attestations = contract.get_subject_attestations(&user_address, &0, &10);

// Search attestations by date range (legacy offset pagination)
let from_ts = 1_700_000_000;
let to_ts = 1_701_000_000;
let attestations = contract.get_attestations_in_range(&user_address, &from_ts, &to_ts, &0, &10);

// Preferred page-after cursor pagination for resilient traversal across deletions
let first_page = contract.get_attestations_in_range_after(
    &user_address,
    &from_ts,
    &to_ts,
    &None,
    &10,
);
let second_page = contract.get_attestations_in_range_after(
    &user_address,
    &from_ts,
    &to_ts,
    &Some(first_page.get(9).unwrap().id.clone()),
    &10,
);

// List issuer's attestations
let issued = contract.get_issuer_attestations(&issuer_address, &0, &10);
```

## Global Statistics

`get_global_stats(env: Env) -> GlobalStats` returns a snapshot of contract-wide counters. No authentication is required — it is safe to call from dashboards, analytics tools, and indexers.

```rust
let stats = contract.get_global_stats();
// stats.total_attestations — all attestations ever created (native, imported, bridged, multi-sig)
// stats.total_revocations  — all revocations ever performed (single + batch)
// stats.total_issuers      — current number of registered issuers
```

**`GlobalStats` fields:**

| Field                | Type  | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `total_attestations` | `u64` | Cumulative count of all attestations created           |
| `total_revocations`  | `u64` | Cumulative count of all revocations                    |
| `total_issuers`      | `u64` | Current registered issuer count (live, not cumulative) |

Stats are updated atomically on every mutating operation:

- `register_issuer` → increments `total_issuers`
- `remove_issuer` → decrements `total_issuers` (saturating at 0)
- `create_attestation`, `import_attestation`, `bridge_attestation` → each increments `total_attestations` by 1
- `create_attestations_batch` → increments `total_attestations` by the number of subjects
- `cosign_attestation` (on threshold reached) → increments `total_attestations` by 1
- `revoke_attestation` → increments `total_revocations` by 1
- `revoke_attestations_batch` → increments `total_revocations` by the number revoked

## Integration Example

Here's how another contract would verify attestations:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address, Env, String};

#[contract]
pub struct LendingContract;

#[contractimpl]
impl LendingContract {
    pub fn borrow(
        env: Env,
        borrower: Address,
        trustlink_contract: Address,
        amount: i128
    ) -> Result<(), Error> {
        borrower.require_auth();

        // Create client for TrustLink contract
        let trustlink = trustlink::Client::new(&env, &trustlink_contract);

        // Verify borrower has valid KYC
        let kyc_claim = String::from_str(&env, "KYC_PASSED");
        let has_kyc = trustlink.has_valid_claim(&borrower, &kyc_claim);

        if !has_kyc {
            return Err(Error::KYCRequired);
        }

        // Proceed with lending logic
        // ...

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Storage Exhaustion Protection

TrustLink enforces configurable limits to prevent malicious issuers from exhausting on-chain storage.

| Limit | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_attestations_per_issuer` | 10,000 | Max attestations a single issuer may create |
| `max_attestations_per_subject` | 100 | Max attestations a single subject may hold |

Attempting to create an attestation beyond either limit returns `Error::LimitExceeded` (code `#10`).

The admin can view and adjust limits at any time:

```rust
// Read current limits
let limits = contract.get_limits();

// Adjust limits (admin only)
contract.set_limits(
    &admin,
    &5_000,  // max per issuer
    &50,     // max per subject
);
```

```bash
# CLI — read limits
soroban contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet -- get_limits

# CLI — update limits (admin)
soroban contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet --source ADMIN_SECRET \
  -- set_limits \
  --admin ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY \
  --max_attestations_per_issuer 5000 \
  --max_attestations_per_subject 50
```

## Error Handling

TrustLink defines clear error types:

- `AlreadyInitialized`: Contract already initialized
- `NotInitialized`: Contract not yet initialized
- `Unauthorized`: Caller lacks required permissions
- `NotFound`: Attestation doesn't exist
- `DuplicateAttestation`: Attestation with same hash already exists
- `AlreadyRevoked`: Attestation already revoked
- `Expired`: Attestation has expired
- `LimitExceeded`: Issuer or subject attestation count has reached the configured limit
- `InvalidThreshold`: Multi-sig threshold is 0 or exceeds signer count
- `NotRequiredSigner`: Cosigner is not in the proposal's required-signers list
- `AlreadySigned`: Issuer has already co-signed the proposal
- `ProposalFinalized`: Proposal has already been activated into an attestation
- `ProposalExpired`: Proposal window (7 days) elapsed without reaching threshold

## Events

TrustLink emits events for off-chain indexing:

**AttestationCreated:**

```rust
topics: ["created", subject_address]
data: (attestation_id, issuer, claim_type, timestamp)
```

**AttestationRevoked:**

```rust
topics: ["revoked", issuer_address]
data: attestation_id
```

**AttestationRenewed:**

```rust
topics: ["renewed", issuer_address]
data: (attestation_id, new_expiration)
```

**IssuerRegistered:**

```rust
topics: ["iss_reg", issuer_address]
data: (admin_address, timestamp)
```

**IssuerRemoved:**

```rust
topics: ["iss_rem", issuer_address]
data: (admin_address, timestamp)
```

**ClaimTypeRegistered:**

```rust
topics: ["clmtype"]
data: (claim_type, description)
```

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- Soroban CLI
- wasm32-unknown-unknown target

### Commands

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Build contract (WASM release)
make build

# Build + optimize WASM
make optimize

# Clean artifacts
make clean

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make clippy
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Build Verification

To verify the WASM build target compiles correctly for Stellar deployment:

```bash
# Build for wasm32-unknown-unknown target
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Verify the WASM artifact exists
ls -la target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trustlink.wasm

# Validate the WASM binary (requires wasm-tools)
cargo install wasm-tools --locked
wasm-tools validate target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trustlink.wasm
```

Or use the Makefile target:

```bash
make build
```

**Build Verification Criteria:**

- ✅ Build exits with code 0
- ✅ `trustlink.wasm` artifact exists in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`
- ✅ WASM file size is reasonable (< 100KB after optimization)
- ✅ No std dependency errors (`#![no_std]` is respected)
- ✅ WASM binary is valid and can be inspected with wasm-objdump

Tests cover:

- Initialization and admin management
- Issuer registration and removal
- Attestation creation with validation
- Duplicate prevention
- Revocation logic
- Expiration handling
- Authorization enforcement
- Pagination
- Cross-contract verification

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: Only admin can manage issuers; only issuers can create attestations
2. **Deterministic IDs**: Prevents replay attacks and ensures uniqueness
3. **Immutable History**: Attestations are never deleted, only marked as revoked
4. **Time-based Expiration**: Automatic invalidation of expired claims
5. **Event Transparency**: All changes are logged for auditability

For a full description of the trust hierarchy, threat model, known limitations,
and operational security recommendations, see [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

For the pre-mainnet line-by-line authorization audit, see
[docs/security-review.md](docs/security-review.md).

## Use Cases

- **DeFi Protocols**: Verify KYC before lending/borrowing
- **Token Sales**: Ensure accredited investor status
- **Payment Systems**: Verify merchant credentials
- **Governance**: Validate voter eligibility
- **Marketplaces**: Confirm seller reputation
- **Insurance**: Verify policyholder identity
- **Stellar Anchors**: End-to-end anchor KYC attestation flow example in [examples/anchor-integration/README.md](examples/anchor-integration/README.md)
- **Soroban Tokens**: KYC-restricted token transfer example in [examples/kyc-token/README.md](examples/kyc-token/README.md)
- **DAO Governance**: Voter eligibility-gated voting example in [examples/governance/README.md](examples/governance/README.md)

## Release Process

TrustLink uses **automated release management** with semantic versioning and conventional commits.

**How it works:**

1. Merge commits to `main` with conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
2. Release Please automatically creates a Release PR with:
   - Updated version in `Cargo.toml`
   - Generated `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Merge the Release PR
4. GitHub Release is created automatically with WASM artifacts attached

**For details, see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md — Commit Message Conventions](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-conventions).**

**Quick reference:**

```bash
# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat(storage): add dual indexing for subject and issuer"

# Push to main (or merge PR)
git push origin main

# Release Please creates a Release PR automatically
# Review, merge, and GitHub Release is published with WASM artifacts
```

## Deployment

TrustLink's Makefile supports deploying to testnet, mainnet, and a local node
with a single command. All network targets build an optimized WASM artifact
before deploying.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt

# Add WASM target (if not already present)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Yes (deploy/invoke) | Stellar secret key (`S...`) used to sign transactions |
| `CONTRACT_ID` | Yes (invoke) | Contract address returned by `deploy` |
| `TESTNET_RPC_URL` | No | Override testnet RPC (default: `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`) |
| `MAINNET_RPC_URL` | No | Override mainnet RPC |
| `LOCAL_RPC_URL` | No | Override local RPC (default: `http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc`) |

Never commit `ADMIN_SECRET` to version control. Always pass it via the shell environment.

### Deploy to testnet

```bash
export ADMIN_SECRET=SXXX...
make deploy                      # NETWORK defaults to testnet
# or explicitly:
make deploy NETWORK=testnet
# or use the convenience alias:
make testnet
```

### Deploy to mainnet

Mainnet deploys prompt for confirmation before proceeding.

```bash
export ADMIN_SECRET=SXXX...
make deploy NETWORK=mainnet
# or:
make mainnet
```

### Deploy to a local node

```bash
export ADMIN_SECRET=SXXX...
make deploy NETWORK=local
# or:
make local
```

### Initialize after deploy

```bash
export CONTRACT_ID=C...          # printed by make deploy
export ADMIN_SECRET=SXXX...

make invoke ARGS='-- initialize --admin <ADMIN_ADDRESS> --ttl_days null'
```

### Invoke any contract function

```bash
export CONTRACT_ID=C...

# Read-only (no ADMIN_SECRET needed)
make invoke ARGS='-- get_admin'
make invoke ARGS='-- is_paused'
make invoke ARGS='-- get_global_stats'

# State-changing (ADMIN_SECRET required)
export ADMIN_SECRET=SXXX...
make invoke ARGS='-- register_issuer --admin <ADMIN> --issuer <ISSUER>'
make invoke ARGS='-- pause --admin <ADMIN>'

# Target a specific network
make invoke NETWORK=mainnet ARGS='-- get_admin'

| ADR                                               | Decision                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-deterministic-ids.md)  | Deterministic IDs instead of sequential counters |
| [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-persistent-storage.md) | Persistent storage instead of temporary storage  |
| [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-immutable-history.md)  | Immutable attestation history (no delete)        |
| [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-dual-indexes.md)       | Separate issuer and subject indexes              |

A blank [template](docs/adr/ADR-000-template.md) is available for new decisions.
